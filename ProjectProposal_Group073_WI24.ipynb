    "With the increasing implementation of AI in various fields and aspects of technology, many concerns have been raised regarding AI’s overtaking of some creative fields. Those concerns from the digital art community include the AI's lack of originality, theft of real human-designed artwork, ownership and copyright issues, and most importantly, the potential loss of jobs in the art industry due to AI use. A survey published in March of 2023 discovered that only 27% of 2000 surveyed U.S. adults have seen AI imagery, but that is not to eliminate that the rest of the survey pool have not.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) It is very likely, with the extent of AI improvements, that they have encountered AI-generated images and lacked awareness of that fact. The inability to discern between AI-generated images and human-generated art can generate success for artificial tools rather real people who make a livelihood of their craft. Only 29% of those who have seen AI imagery said that it was not to the same standards as human art, while 31% said it was, and 34% believed it was even better than human art.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) The widespread use of AI images and the general inability to discern between it and human art jeopardizes the careers of real online artists, which is why we would like to assess, through measurable data collected from social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit, the success metric of AI imagery compared to human-generated art. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with discerning between art that is generated by AI or created by humans, the existence of AI art also impacts how favorably people tend to view both types of images. A study conducted with art experts and non-experts alike on their opinions on AI-generated vs. artist made paintings found that art experts were more inclined to view AI paintings more negatively and were less likely to want to purchase them. However, it also found that non-experts had no difference of opinion between the two types, suggesting that art expertise was related to willingness to enjoy and buy AI-generated art.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) The results of this research further indicate that the careers of real artists are at stake if non-art experts, which make up a majority of an artist’s audience, cannot differentiate between AI and real art and do not necessarily prefer real art over AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this endeavor to make sense of where AI fits into the realm of art and creativity, additional research has examined the overall attitudes on AI and art among people. One longitudinal study found that positive attitudes towards AI and art seemed to be connected to having a sense of autonomy over AI, in that it still requires human input to create. Thus, it may be important to emphasize AI as a tool for artists instead of a complete replacement to find more general positive attitudes towards AI imagery <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). These differing attitudes on artificial intelligence in art give us all the more reason to further explore how AI imagery is viewed relative to human made art, as well as what potential factors contribute to these perspectives.\n",

    "### **Ideal** dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal dataset to answer our question would have various variables related to both AI and human generated artwork. These variables would be:\n",
    "- Type of artwork: AI or human generated\n",
    "- Time of artwork: When was the artwork created\n",
    "- Characteristics: Genre, style, subject\n",
    "- Artist demographic: Age, gender, origin, education\n",
    "- Ratings: Art reviews or ratings\n",
    "- Success metric: Art engagement (likes, comments, shares), sales, awards, recognition\n",
    "- Platform: Social media, art gallery, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "With these variables, we would be able to measure the success of AI and human generated artwork to compare whether or not there exists a relationship between the two. For our ideal dataset, we would have tens of thousands of observations to ensure that we have data from all types of AI and human generated artwork across different variable combinations. This amount and variety of data would allow us to complete a thorough analysis. We could collect our data from using web scraping from social media, online art platforms, marketplaces, museum websites, portfolios, etc. To get more information about the artworks, surveys could be sent out to the artists about their demographics and success in the art community, keeping their identity anonymous to protect the artists' privacy.  This data would be organized using a structured format, likely a csv file with rows being a single piece of artwork, and columns being the variables listed above. We would also have to document our data and collections methods for transparency.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. [TWIGMA: A dataset of AI-Generated Images with Metadata From Twitter](https://zenodo.org/records/8031785)\n",
    "2. [AI Text-2-Image Tweets (+ Sentiment labels)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/ai-text2image-tweets)\n",
    "3. [Reddit: /r/Art](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncovering-online-art-trends-with-reddit-posting)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above are links to datasets that we found that could be useful to answer our question. It was difficult to find a single dataset that had all the ideal variables listed previously, but we managed to find seperate datasets for AI and human generated art. The first two datasets have information about AI-generated artworks from Twitter specifically, including tweet date, like count, comment count, and retweet count, providing valuable insight to enagagement levels of AI-generated artworks. The third dataset has information about human-generated artworks from Reddit, including post data, upvote count, and comment count. What we found differs from our ideal dataset because they do not have data of artworks across various platforms, and we do not have much information on the characteristics or demographics of the artist. We can supplement this by using text analytical techniques on text body, titles, and hashtags to find out more information about the artwork. We also cannot be sure that all artworks in the Reddit dataset are not AI-generated, however, for the purpose of our analysis, we can assume they are human generated based on the nature of the subreddit community. Obviously these datasets are not ideal, so we would have to do some data wrangling and EDA to completely understand our data and figure out how we can measure success with what we have available. Even then, comparing success of artwork across two different platforms will be challenging, so we would use proportions of likes/upvotes instead of with raw data to make meaningful comparisons."

    "As we are comparing whether art made by both AI or real people is more favored, there is a problem of artists’ privacy when using their art. It is important to anonymize any information we may collect about the artists by omitting personally identifiable information as it may leave a bad impression to the public if the real art is ranked lower than AI-generated art. It would also be difficult to understand whether these individual artists consented to having their art and discussion on their art scraped from the internet into a database. As most of the personally identifiable information seems to be removed from the databases we found, we will assume informed consent on their part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, as we currently found art from Reddit and Twitter, there is clearly bias in the kind of people that would post on these social media platforms. This audience is likely to be young adults, and thus our data is mostly skewed towards how younger people feel about art versus AI art. Furthermore, how successful art is (in this case, we coin “success” as proportion of upvotes) sometimes relies on the algorithm and whether it recommends it to users. We have no insight on how the algorithm works for Twitter or Reddit, so there could be inherent biases that we are unaware of. To mitigate these biases, we should make sure we understand how our datasets are collected, and address the biases that may be present. We should put out disclaimers before publishing our work on all the potential biases that our data has. We should also make sure that if any artists do want their art to be removed from our data analysis, we can easily drop it from the dataset. We will also only keep the dataset for as long as we need it, and delete it after we have finalized and published our findings by the end of this quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another ethical concern is our questions themselves. We also want to be wary of how our findings could negatively impact the art community. Our conclusion should in no way be suggestive that one type of art performs significantly better than another, and it should never discourage production of authentic art. We strive to be transparent on how our data is collected, how we clean and explore the data, and how our question uses our data meaningfully. We must present visualizations that are not deceptive and earnestly convey our findings. Moreover, our team of 5 will try to cross-check to ensure that we do not have any biases when conducting the hypothesis, ex: selecting certain observations instead of using the entire dataset or drawing conclusions based on biased opinions. These are all steps that could help ensure the reproducibility/ replicability of our data analysis. We should also make sure to do fairness testing across groups to make sure that our data analysis is not biased towards a certain attribute or group.\n"
